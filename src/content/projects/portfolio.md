Welcome to my personal portfolio — the site you're browsing right now!

This site showcases the projects I’ve worked on and the tools I enjoy using. It’s designed to be fast, clean, and easy to maintain, built with modern web technologies:

- **[Astro](https://astro.build/)** – for fast and flexible static site generation
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** – for a utility-first approach to styling
- **[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)** – used in various components for interactivity and dynamic behavior  
- **[Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)** – for global, high-performance hosting

I use this space to document and share my work, highlight web development skills, and provide context around each project — from technical choices to design decisions.

Feel free to explore the [Projects](/projects) section to see what I’ve been working on!
