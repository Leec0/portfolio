**Global Gourmets** is a collaborative web project developed by a team of four students, including myself, during our second year at [KdG University of Applied Sciences and Arts](https://www.kdg.be/en). This project was part of the **Communications 2** course, aiming to create a dynamic platform that explores global cuisines and cultural food stories.
