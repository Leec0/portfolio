The **Graffiti Printer** is a custom-built machine I created together with two friends as our IP (integrated project) for our secondary school degree in Industrial Science.

It’s powered by an **Arduino** with a **CNC shield** and programmed in **C++**. The machine moves a spray can in two dimensions to create graffiti-style text or patterns on vertical surfaces.

We had no prior experience with hardware programming, so we had to figure out most of the logic ourselves — from how stepper motors work to how to translate text into movement. Because of that, the code isn’t exactly production quality, but we’re proud of what we pulled off given the circumstances.

We learned a lot by doing, experimenting, and troubleshooting — with no formal guidance on how to build or program something like this.
